# Command Contracts

This file defines functional contracts for `commands/*.md` and the universal
`SKILL.md` behavior. Use it as a review checklist before releases.

## Global Contracts

1. `<script id="spec-meta">` JSON in `SPEC.html` is authoritative for identity;
   `data-status` attributes are authoritative for lifecycle; registry is
   denormalized.
2. Exactly one active spec should exist after any write operation.
3. All write workflows update `SPEC.html` first (including a successful
   `validate.md` run), then recompute/update registry.
4. Forge workflow never writes application code.
5. Phase status uses `data-status="pending"` | `"in-progress"` | `"completed"` |
   `"blocked"`. Task status uses the same values; AC status uses only
   `pending` / `completed`.
6. **Progress tracking is sacred.** After every task completion: edit
   `SPEC.html` (`data-status` swap, phase transition if applicable, updated
   date), run `references/validate.md`, update registry (progress, date),
   then re-read both files to verify consistency. Never skip this.
7. **Acceptance criteria are required for feature specs.** Forge must include
   an Acceptance Criteria region with `<li class="ac-item" data-status="pending">`
   testable conditions. Implement must update `data-status="completed"` on
   criteria as they are satisfied and verify all are met before marking a
   spec complete.
8. **No mid-task state.** HTML specs checkpoint at task boundaries only —
   there is no Resume Context section. Pause/resume always lands on a
   clean task boundary.

## Command Contracts

### `/specmint-core-html:forge`

1. Resolve `<spec-id>` before research output paths are referenced.
2. Collision-check existing spec IDs before creating new files (check
   `.specs/<id>/SPEC.html` and registry).
3. Forge must not run in plan mode; if plan mode is active, require exit
   before continuing.
4. Refresh `.specs/assets/` on every forge: copy `spec-styles.css` and
   `spec-runtime.js` from the plugin's `assets/` directory, **overwriting
   any existing files**. The runtime is plugin-managed; overwrite-on-forge
   ensures existing projects pick up rendering fixes.
5. Output scope is `.specs/` artifacts only (`research-*.md`,
   `interview-*.md`, `SPEC.html`, `registry.md` updates, assets on first run).
6. After approval, handoff to `/specmint-core-html:implement` instead of
   implementing inside forge.
7. Interview must ask about acceptance criteria ("What does 'done' look like?").
8. **If UI work is in scope, interview must ask about mockup fidelity**
   (`wireframe` / `hi-fi` / `none`) and store the answer in the
   `mockup-fidelity` field of the spec-meta JSON.
9. SPEC.html must include all canonical regions: `meta`, `toc`, `header`,
   `overview`, `acceptance`, `architecture`, `libraries`, `phases`, `code`
   (may be empty), `mockups` (omitted entirely if fidelity is `none`),
   `decisions`, `deviations`.
10. Forge must run `references/validate.md` before presenting the spec.
11. SPEC.html must be derived from `references/html-template.html`.

### `/specmint-core-html:implement`

1. Supports scope parsing: current flow, phase-specific, all phases, task code.
2. For each completed task: swap `data-status="pending"` →
   `data-status="completed"` in `SPEC.html`, run `references/validate.md`,
   update registry progress/date. Re-read both files to verify consistency.
3. At phase completion: update phase `data-status` + pill class, promote
   next phase to `in-progress`, review and update satisfied acceptance
   criteria.
4. At spec completion: verify all acceptance criteria have
   `data-status="completed"` before marking complete.
5. Blocked handling:
   - Set blocked tasks to `data-status="blocked"`.
   - Mark phase `data-status="blocked"` only when the whole phase is blocked.
   - Record blocker context in the Decision Log or Deviations.

### `/specmint-core-html:resume`

1. If no active spec exists, list specs and request target.
2. Parse progress from `SPEC.html` `data-status` counts.
3. Identify current phase (first phase with `data-status="in-progress"`)
   and current task (first task with `data-status="pending"` in that phase).
4. Present a compact summary. No separate Resume Context section to read.

### `/specmint-core-html:pause`

1. If no active spec exists, report no-op and stop.
2. Finalize state at the current task boundary — every completed task has
   the right `data-status`.
3. Add session decisions to the Decision Log.
4. Set status `paused` (JSON + visible pill) and sync registry.
5. Run `references/validate.md`.

### `/specmint-core-html:switch`

1. Validate target ID and target `SPEC.html` existence before pausing
   current spec.
2. If target already active, report and stop.
3. Pause current (if any), activate target, resume target, sync registry.

### `/specmint-core-html:list`

1. Handle missing registry gracefully.
2. Group by status in order: active, paused, completed, archived.
3. If `SPEC.html` missing for a row, keep row visible and flag it.
4. Compute task counts by reading each `SPEC.html` and counting
   `<li class="task">` elements by `data-status`.

### `/specmint-core-html:status`

1. Show detailed phase/task breakdown for active spec.
2. If no active spec, guide to activate one.

### `/specmint-core-html:openapi`

1. Generate/update `.openapi/openapi.yaml` and `.openapi/endpoints/*.md`.
2. Preserve manual additions when updating existing files.
3. Report endpoint/schema/security counts and manual-review candidates.
4. OpenAPI output stays as YAML + markdown — not HTML.

## Universal Skill Contract

1. `SKILL.md` must include cross-tool behavior for all declared triggers.
2. If `generate openapi` is listed as a trigger, OpenAPI workflow behavior
   must be defined in `SKILL.md` (not only plugin command files).
3. Command-specific docs can specialize behavior but cannot violate critical
   invariants from `SKILL.md`.

## Release Checklist

1. `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json` passes.
2. `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json` passes without
   warnings.
3. Paths referenced in docs and templates exist (excluding placeholder paths).
4. Command contracts in this file still match `commands/*.md` and `SKILL.md`.
5. `assets/spec-styles.css` and `assets/spec-runtime.js` exist and are
   distributed to consumer projects' `.specs/assets/` on first forge.
6. `references/html-template.html` validates with `references/validate.md`.
